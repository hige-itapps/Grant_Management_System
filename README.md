# Grant_Management_System
A grant management system to be implemented at the Haenicke Institute for Global Education (HIGE) at WMU

Specifically, this system handles the International Education Faculty Development Fund (IEFDF) processes for HIGE in the form of a website. Faculty members may access the site via the CAS login using their Bronco NetIDs. If possible, they may fill out an application form which can later be accessed and reviewed by HIGE staff.
